CapabilityMaps
==============
This is a force directed graph that allows a user to find intersections of people across disciplines.
It uses D3 to render and searches an ElasticSearch index.
The Elastic index is populated by vivo data via the code in https://github.com/tetherless-world/dco-elasticsearch

The original interface was designed and developed by MatÄ›j Korvas, Martin Kwok, Melissa Makin, and Simon Porter from University of Melbourne.
The Capability Map interface was originally designed to work with the Funnelback search engine over University of Melbourne VIVO data

To render the capability maps, an interface has been built using d3js over the JSON search objects.
