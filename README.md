CapabilityMaps
==============
This interface was designed and developed by MatÄ›j Korvas, Martin Kwok, Melissa Makin, and Simon Porter.
For further information contact simon.porter@unimelb.edu.au.

The Capability Map interface was designed to work with the Funnelback search engine over University of Melbourne VIVO data

Funnelback indexs VIVO data via the supplied SPARQL query.
The resulting data is then mapped to Funnelback metadata fields (see xml.cfg)

The funnelback browser has been configure to output two JSON search result types.

The freemarker templates for these are included for reference.

To render the capability maps, an interface has been built using d3js over the JSON search objects.
